# PlayAndLearn

A 2013 Project for the Bulgarian National IT Olympiad.
Baisically a simple Scratch game with a lot of duplicated code. 
One of the first projects I worked hard on (and was really proud of... why though?), but got me into thinking about OOP and Good coding practices without even hearing for them. :)
