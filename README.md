# PlayAndLearn

A project for the Bulgarian National IT Olympiad (2012/2013) placed 14th in the final round.
Baisically a simple Scratch game with a lot of duplicated code. One of the first projects I worked hard on (age 12), but got me into thinking about OOP and good coding practices without me even knowing.
